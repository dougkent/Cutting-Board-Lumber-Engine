# CuttingBoardLumberCalculator
Simple tool for determining how much lumber to get for a particular size end-grain cutting board. It also generates a cut list for the cutting board.

I created this tool to help me learn some new programming languages and it is not meant to be deployed to production. There are some shortfalls with form validation as well as invalid inputs into the GraphQL, Express server.

## To Run
It does require docker to be installed.
1. Clone Repository
2. Open a commandline prompt at root of repository.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
